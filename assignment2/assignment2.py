# Assignment 2: Are You an Introvert?

# Name: TODO: Replace with your name

print("Answer the following questions with 'yes' or 'no':")

# TODO: Prompt the user to answer the following 4 yes/no questions:
# 1. Do you prefer spending time alone?
# 2. Do you find large gatherings draining?
# 3. Do you enjoy deep one-on-one conversations over small talk?
# 4. Do you often reflect before speaking or acting?
# Rather than using the print function, we can combine
# prompting the user and reading their input using the following syntax
# answer = input("your prompt goes here")
# You should have four different variables to store the
# four different responses corresponding to the four different prompts

# TODO Create four different bool variables, A-D, that will be True if the answer was "yes" and False otherwise.

# TODO: Replace this with the simplified Boolean expression that you derived using the K-map
introvert = ...  # ‚Üê your Boolean logic here
